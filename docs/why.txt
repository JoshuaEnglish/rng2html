Why
===

Pure bloody laziness.

The idea behind this stupid waste of time is to take
an RelaxNG definition of data and create HTML forms
to serve using some local server like Bottle or something.

This is, in theory, easy to do with XSLT.

Then the server has to handle the data from the
form, turn it into some sort of XML document, and send the results
back to the web page.
